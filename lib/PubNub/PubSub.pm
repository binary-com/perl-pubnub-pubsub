PubNub::PubSub - Perl library for rapid publishing of messages on PubNub.com

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PubNub::PubSub;

    my $pubnub = PubNub::PubSub->new(
        pub_key => 'demo', # only required for publish
        sub_key => 'demo',

    # publish

            # $res is a L<Mojo::Message::Response>
            say $res->code; # 200

        messages => ['message3', 'message4']
    });

    # subscribe
    $pubnub->subscribe({
        callback => sub {
            my (@messages) = @_;
            foreach my $msg (@messages) {

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PubNub::PubSub is Perl library for rapid publishing of messages on PubNub.com based on L<Mojo::UserAgent>

perl clone of L<https://gist.github.com/stephenlb/9496723#pubnub-http-pipelining>

For a rough test:

=over 4

=item * run perl examples/subscribe.pl in one terminal (or luanch may terminals with subscribe.pl)

=item * run perl examples/publish.pl in another terminal (you'll see all subscribe terminals will get messages.)

=back

=head1 METHOD

=head2 new

=over 4

=item * pub_key

optional, default pub_key for publish

=item * sub_key

optional, default sub_key for all methods

=item * channel

optional, default channel for all methods

=item * publish_callback

optional. default callback for publish

=item * debug

set ENV MOJO_USERAGENT_DEBUG to debug

=back

=head2 subscribe

subscribe channel to listen for the messages.

    $pubnub->subscribe({
        callback => sub {
            my (@messages) = @_;
            foreach my $msg (@messages) {
                print "# Got message: $msg\n";
            }
            return 1; # 1 to continue, 0 to stop
        }
    });

return 0 to stop

=head2 publish

publish messages to channel

    $pubnub->publish({
        messages => ['message1', 'message2'],
        callback => sub {
            my ($res) = @_;

            # $res is a L<Mojo::Message::Response>
            say $res->code; # 200
            say Dumper(\$res->json); # [1,"Sent","14108733777591385"]
        }
    });
    $pubnub->publish({
        channel  => 'sandbox2', # optional, if not applied, the one in ->new will be used.
        messages => ['message3', 'message4']
    });

Note if you need shared callback, please pass it when do ->new with B<publish_callback>.

new Parameters specifically for B<Publish V2 ONLY>

=over 4

=item * ortt - Origination TimeToken where "r" = DOMAIN and "t" = TIMETOKEN

=item * meta - any JSON payload - intended as a safe and unencrypted payload

=item * ear - Eat At Read (read once)

=item * seqn - Sequence Number - for Guaranteed Delivery/Ordering

=back

We'll first try to read from B<messages>, if not specified, fall back to the same level as messages. eg:

    $pubnub->publish({
        messages => [
            {
                message => 'test message.',
                ortt => {
                    "r" => 13,
                    "t" => "13978641831137500"
                },
                meta => {
                    "stuff" => []
                },
                ear  => 'True',
                seqn => 12345,
            },
            {
                ...
            }
        ]
    });

    ## if you have common part, you can specified as the same level as messages
    $pubnub->publish({
        messages => [
            {
                message => 'test message.',
                ortt => {
                    "r" => 13,
                    "t" => "13978641831137500"
                },
                seqn => 12345,
            },
            {
                ...
            }
        ],
        meta => {
            "stuff" => []
        },
        ear  => 'True',
    });

=head2 history

fetches historical messages of a channel

=over 4

=item * sub_key

optional, default will use the one passed to ->new

=item * channel

optional, default will use the one passed to ->new

=item * count

Specifies the number of historical messages to return. The Default is 100.

=item * reverse

Setting to true will traverse the time line in reverse starting with the newest message first. Default is false. If both start and end arguments are provided, reverse is ignored and messages are returned starting with the newest message.

=item * start

Time token delimiting the start of time slice (exclusive) to pull messages from.

=item * end

Time token delimiting the end of time slice (inclusive) to pull messages from.

=back

Sample code:

    my $history = $pubnub->history({
        count => 20,
        reverse => "false"
    });
    # $history is [["message1", "message2", ... ],"Start Time Token","End Time Token"]

for example, to fetch all the rows in history

    my $history = $pubnub->history({
        reverse => "true",
    });
    while (1) {
        print Dumper(\$history);
        last unless @{$history->[0]}; # no messages
        sleep 1;
        $history = $pubnub->history({
            reverse => "true",
            start => $history->[2]
        });
    }

=head1 JSON USAGE

This module effectively runs a Mojolicious application in the background.  For
those parts of JSON which do not have a hard Perl equivalent, such as booleans,
the Mojo::JSON module's semantics work.  This means that JSON bools are 
handled as references to scalar values 0 and 1 (i.e. \0 for false and \1 for 
true).

This has changed since 0.08, where True and False were used.
